## 2026-05-14 — Engine, scope, scraping, cost rules (planning lock — backfill = Option A)
**Scope:** shared (all roles)
**Proposed by:** lead (with user)
**Status:** LOCKED 2026-05-14 — all 6 sub-decisions confirmed. Backfill resolved to Option A (background trickle via Max 20x quota) in continuation session.

**Decisions:**

1. **LLM engine: Claude Code CLI in headless mode** (`claude -p` subprocess from pipeline service, optionally Agent SDK later). Uses user's Claude Max 20x subscription quota — **no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in pipeline**. Interactive CLI reserved for dev/research/manual investigation by the user only.
   - Pipeline Dockerfile must install `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` and mount user's `~/.claude` for session auth.
   - Prompt definitions + JSON-parsing layer kept **separate** from invocation layer so we can swap to API key later without rewriting prompts.

2. **News scraping: Firecrawl Cloud free tier** (500 scrapes/month). Covers the 4 scrape sources (ทันหุ้น, ข่าวหุ้น, กรุงเทพธุรกิจ, ฐานเศรษฐกิจ) at 2 fetches/day. RSS sources (Settrade, SET.or.th, Bangkok Post, Thailand Business News) continue using `feedparser` directly — no Firecrawl call needed for RSS.
   - Replaces the PRD's Playwright + BeautifulSoup plan (~500MB+ Docker savings).
   - License note: Firecrawl self-hosted is AGPL-3.0; single-user personal use does not trigger AGPL obligations. Cloud free tier is SaaS — no license concern at all.
   - Migration plan: if scraping volume exceeds free tier, evaluate self-host vs Hobby tier ($19/mo, 3K).

3. **Phase 1 scope: Thai stocks only, 2 LangGraph nodes** (News Agent + Synthesizer). No Technical/Pattern/Macro agents in Phase 1. Gold/crypto/international defer to Phase 4+.
   - Drops the multi-agent QuantAgent-style decomposition from initial scope to keep MVP tight.
   - Vision-based Pattern Agent dropped entirely from current plan (vision LLM ~5-10x cost).
   - LangGraph orchestration also **deferred** — Phase 1 uses Lead-as-orchestrator pattern (pipeline service calls `claude -p` sequentially); revisit LangGraph if/when 3+ agents land.

4. **Model usage rules in pipeline:**
   - **Sonnet only** for extraction, sentiment, and synthesizer calls (current PRD default — confirmed).
   - **Haiku** for low-stakes tasks: dedup embedding compare, title classification, language detection.
   - **Opus** never in pipeline. Reserved for manual user investigation via interactive Claude Code CLI.
   - **Prompt caching enabled** when batching multiple articles in one Sonnet system-prompt window (5-min TTL).
   - **AgentRun table tracks token usage and inferred cost per call** even though Max 20x is flat-fee — needed for "when do we migrate to API key" decision later.

5. **Human is the sole decision-maker.** AI emits `AIRecommendation` (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral + reasoning + confidence + per-agent breakdown). User reviews in Frontend, then submits `UserDecision` (extends PRD's `DecisionTag` with `ai_recommendation_id` FK). No auto-trade, no execution integration ever — out of scope.

6. **Backfill 1 year — LOCKED: Option A (background trickle via Max 20x quota).**
   - Free in $ terms — uses the same Max 20x quota the live pipeline runs on.
   - Tradeoff accepted: ~2-4 weeks elapsed wall-time to fill 1y history (rate-limit bounded). Runs in parallel with live ingestion from Phase 1 launch.
   - Implementation hint: separate `BackfillJob` row tracks per-source progress (last-fetched-date cursor); pipeline runs backfill calls in low-priority lane behind live calls so daily quota doesn't starve fresh data.
   - Rejected: Option B (API key + Batch API ~$10-30, 1-2 days) — keeps $0-MVP story intact + avoids `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` introduction at this phase. Revisit only if a future analysis use-case demands faster history (e.g., backtesting before Phase 1B closes).
   - Rejected: Option C (defer) — chose to lock now so backfill design seams (BackfillJob model, low-priority lane) land with Phase 0 scaffold instead of retrofitting later.

7. **Port plan: NewsAnalyzer = `7xxx` range, no port shared with agent-teams.**
   - Mnemonic: agent-teams uses 5xxx/8xxx (web=5431, api=8456, langgraph=8465, db=5432); NewsAnalyzer claims 7xxx so both can run in parallel.
   - Allocations: `frontend=7010` (Next.js), `backend=7020` (FastAPI), `pipeline=7021` (FastAPI controller), `db=7042` (Postgres — avoids 5432 collision), `redis=7079`.
   - Rewrite scope: `docker-compose.dev.yml` + `docker-compose.prod.yml` publish-port mappings; `frontend/package.json` "dev" script (`next dev --port 7010`); backend + pipeline uvicorn CMD (in Dockerfiles or compose `command:`); `.env.dev` / `.env.prod` URL env vars (BACKEND_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_PIPELINE_URL, DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL); any hardcoded `localhost:8000` / `localhost:3010` in code/docs.
   - Locked because: previous default 3010/8000/8001/5432/6379 either looks generic (5432 collision risk) or sits near common defaults (3010 too close to 3000). Distinct 7xxx range is harder to accidentally collide with other local stacks the user runs.
   - Rationale for putting in lock entry: port rewrite is bundled with T1 (engine migration — same Dockerfile + compose touches) so doing both in one task minimizes compose-file churn.

**Reasoning:**
- User has Max 20x → marginal LLM cost = 0 during MVP. Picking CLI over API key avoids burning real $ until product proves out.
- Firecrawl Cloud free tier sized to the actual daily fetch volume (8 sources × 2/day × 30 ≈ 480/mo).
- Scope cut to Thai stocks + 2 agents because system is greenfield (only `api/health.py` exists today) — start minimal, prove the loop, then expand.
- Cost rules locked at decision time so we don't accidentally call Opus from pipeline 6 months later when no one remembers.
- Backfill is the only thing that breaks the "free" story (volume × token cost is real even on Max 20x via rate limits) — explicit choice required.

**Implications:**
- Pipeline `requirements.txt` adds `firecrawl-py`, drops `playwright` + `beautifulsoup4` (RSS-only feedparser stays).
- Pipeline Dockerfile adds Node.js + `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` install + `~/.claude` mount.
- Backend schema adds: `Asset`, `PriceBar` (Phase 2 onward), `AgentRun`, `AIRecommendation`, `UserDecision` (FK to `ai_recommendation_id`). PRD's `DecisionTag` either renamed to `UserDecision` or extended.
- PRD addendum needed — capture engine choice, Firecrawl integration, and revised phase plan (dev-documentor task after Phase 0 scaffold lands).
- Next Kanban tasks queue (Phase 0 scaffold): backend + frontend + pipeline scaffold, Docker compose verify, alembic baseline, seed default `NewsSource` rows, seed `TagClass` predefined rows.
